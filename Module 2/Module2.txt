Relationship Query Limitations
- More than 55 child to parent relationships can not be specified in a query. A custom object allows up to 25 relationships.
- More than 20 parent to child relationships can not be specified in a query.
- In every child to parent relationship, more than five levels can not be specified. Ex A.B.C (2 levels)
- In parent to child relationships, we can specify only one query.
- External objects don’t support the ORDER BY clause in relationship queries.

SOSL Limits
- The SOSL query can be up to 100000 characters(by default) but in general, if query length is more than the 10000 then no result will be returned. 
  If query length is more than the 4000 then logical operators are removed and then the query is executed so in this case you get more results than expected.
- SOQL Query can return maximum 2000 results
