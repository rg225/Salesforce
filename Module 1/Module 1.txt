Salesforce Module 1

Multitenant architecture
It means we can do many tasks on a single platform like a sales cloud, service cloud, marking cloud and whole data is stored in the single database for all customers. Here we share one resource between all of them.

SObject Relationships
SObject relationships can be categorized in 2 parts lookup and master-detail relationship. Master-detail relationship can be used as the parent child relationship if we delete any record form parent then related child records will automatically get deleted. In the lookup relationship we just create the relationship between 2 objects, but they are not tightly coupled with each other. There we can also use junction object this is nothing but a custom object which can have 2 master-detail relationships. This is useful when we want many to many relationships.

Formula Fields
Formula field we can use for mathematical calculations, like if we want to calculate the age of any student then we can calculate it by using the formula field, there we have no need to calculate it manually. Even we can perform more complex calculations using this. One more interesting thing is that formula fields are executed in real time. It means this data does not store anywhere and if our value of the respective field is changed then we will get a new correct result. It support many data types like date, time, currency, checkbox, number etc.This also support cross object formula fields in which we can access fields of child object and parents object. We can get data up to 10 relationships.

Rollup Summary Fields
Rollup summary is a field which works only with master detail relationships. As its name suggests it is used to summarize the child object values like count, max, min, sum. For example if we want to calculate the total donation from the donation (Child object) then we can do it by using a rollup summary field and there we will use sum.
