Process limits and considerations 


* Process Limits :
Active process per object can be up to 50
Total process up to 4000 and active can be up to 2000
2000 criteria nodes and actions are evaluated at run time for one process
1000 per day email limit for standard and 15 for developer and overall org limit is 2000000


Process name can have 255 word and API can have 79 words
Total version can be 50 and criteria nodes up to 200 for a process


* Process Usage-Based Entitlements:
Maximum pause and waiting flow interviews can be up to 50000


* Order of execution 
1  Validation rules
2 Assignment rules
3 Auto response rules
4 Workflow rules and processes


* Process in evaluated when a record is saved and created
* Processes can reevaluate records up to five times in one save operation
* A record change can trigger more than one process. You can’t determine which process starts first.


* Processes Don’t Evaluate Record Changes When:
Picklist, Address, division fields are mass updated


* Best practices 
If one object have one process and some other workflow then we can not predict output so deactivate workflow rules before activating process .
Have only one record process for per object
















Objects
Process Builder doesn’t support:
* Deprecated custom objects
* Signup Request — unsupported in schedules only
* Social Post
* Social Persona
External Objects
* External objects aren’t supported in record-change processes.
* When you create or update external object records, don’t set values for indirect lookup relationships that map to a different data type on the external system. For example, don’t set a value for a Text indirect lookup relationship that maps to a Date value on the external system.
Custom Fields
* Process Builder doesn’t support custom fields of type File.
* If a process references a custom field:
   * You can’t delete the field.
   * If you change the field type or name, the process breaks.
   * If you change the field label, the process doesn’t break. But it still uses the original label.
Duplicate Rules
If a duplicate is found when a process tries to create or update a record, the process fails.


Process Formula Limitations
All formulas that are used in a criteria node must:
* Return true or false. If the formula returns true, the associated actions are executed.
* Not contain more than 3,000 characters.
* Not contain an unsupported function.
* Reference the process trigger object for that process.
* Use the correct capitalization when referring to the process trigger object.
Process Schedule Limitations
* If an action group contains scheduled actions, you can’t continue evaluating the next criteria in your process after executing those actions.
* SignupRequest processes don’t support scheduled actions.
* Field-based schedules can’t reference a Date or Date/Time field that contains automatically derived functions, such as TODAY or NOW.
* Field-based schedules can’t reference a formula field that includes related-object merge fields.
* If you add a schedule for 0 Days Before a date, when you later reopen the process, the schedule changes to 0 Days After the date. The process still executes at the specified time.
Process Builder Design Considerations:
* Be careful while creating the processes are not going into the infinite loop.
* If you create a Process instead of Existing Workflow or Apex Triggers, Make sure that you deleted the existing workflow or Apex Trigger otherwise the unexpected results might occur.
* The Length of Process Name must be within 255 characters.
* The Length of Process’s API Name must be within 77 characters.
* A Process can have maximum of 200 Criteria Nodes and can be associated for a single object.
* Actions are executed in the order in which they appear in the process builder
* Cannot Activate the Process if any Process contains “Email Alerts” Action and Scheduled actions within the process.
* Process Builder doesn’t support the “File Type” custom fields.
* If the Message in “Chatter Post” Action starts with the field reference like {![Account].name}, Then the “Chatter Post” action may fail to save.
* A Process Can have up to 50 Versions but only single Version can be in “Active”.
